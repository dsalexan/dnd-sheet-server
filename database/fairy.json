In the humanoid form a fairy could almostlyr be mistaken for a high elf - if not for their irregular eyes (often entirely black, or with unnaturally large irises in an iridescent rainbow of varying colors) and the wings (not as big proportionally when compared to it’s tiny form) that unfold from their shoulder blades. Fairies can change between Fae form and Humanoid form for a maximum of once between short or long rests. For a extra change before a rest, you gain one point of exhaustion.</p>",
